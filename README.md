# **Docker & Vagrant**

Small demonstration scripts for using Vagrant and Docker, or a combination of Docker and Vagrant (or Vagrant and Docker)

## **Environments**

There are two strategies to go about using these tools, using Vagrant as the driver, or Docker-Machine as the driver.  Naturally, when understanding the ins and outs of these tools, you can mix and match.

### **Vagrant Based**
1. [Vagrant with Shell Provisioner](1-tier/vagrant-shell/README.md)
- [Vagrant with Docker Provisioner](1-tier/vagrant-docker/README.md)

### **Docker Machine Based**
1. [Docker-Machine using Virtualbox Driver](1-tier/vagrant-provision-shell/README.md)
- [Docker-Machine using Generic Driver with Vagrant](1/-tier/machine-vagrant/README.md)
